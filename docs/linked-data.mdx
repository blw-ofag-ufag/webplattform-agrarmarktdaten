# Linked Data

The data shown on the "Analysis" tab of the website is published as open data on the Linked Data platform Lindas by following these steps:

- **Data Collection**: The Swiss government collects agricultural market data from various sources, including surveys, agencies, and relevant departments.

- **Data Structuring**: Before publishing on Lindas, the collected data is structured and organized into a standardized format. This often involves converting data into RDF (Resource Description Framework) format, a common format for Linked Data.

- **Lindas Integration**: The data is then uploaded to Lindas, which is a platform designed to host and disseminate Linked Data. Lindas allows Swiss government agencies to share their data in a structured and standardized manner.

- **Data Enrichment**: To make the data more valuable and interconnected, Lindas may enrich it with links to other related datasets and ontologies. This enhances the context and meaning of the data, making it more useful for analysis.

- **Access Permissions**: Lindas manages access permissions, ensuring that the data is accessible to the public or specific user groups, depending on the government's data-sharing policies.

- **API Integration**: The "Analysis" tab on the website utilizes APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) provided by Lindas to fetch and display the data in real-time. These APIs allow the website to access and present the latest agricultural market data from Lindas.

By following these steps, the Swiss government makes its agricultural market data available as open data on Lindas, which can be easily accessed and analyzed by the public through the website's "Analysis" tab. This approach fosters transparency, accessibility, and data-driven decision-making in the agricultural sector.

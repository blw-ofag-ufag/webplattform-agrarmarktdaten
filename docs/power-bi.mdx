# Power BI Reports

The integration of a Power BI report curated by IT-Logix is demonstrated with the example of the report named "Auswertung Durchschnittspreis Früchte und Gemüse 2006-2019". The report is linked from the market pages "Potatoes" and "Fruits & Vegetables". The embedded report opens as a separate page within the platform.

Currently, there is only one report available. In a future iteration, it will be possible to customize the power BI report displayed for a specific market, by defining its ID in the CMS Dashboard.

The library [PowerBI-JavaScript](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerBI-JavaScript), maintained by Microsoft, is used to embed the report in the app.

## Market Data Platform

The Agriculture Market Data Platform serves as the communication central hub of the Market Analyzing Unit of the Federal Office for Agriculture (FOAG). It provides access to the latest news, general information, reports and customized data queries for each of the different markets.

### Design Concept

The design concept for the platform is available in the following form:

- [Clickable InVision prototype (Desktop version)](/invision-prototypes/platform-desktop/index.html)
- [Clickable InVision prototype (Mobile version)](/invision-prototypes/platform-mobile/index.html)
- [Keyscreen Mockups (ZIP file)](/keyscreens/200326_market-data-platform-platform-keyscreens.zip)

### Open Questions

Open questions and answers from the prototype are documented in this [Excel file](/200326_Fragen_Webprototyp_Antworten-IXT.xlsx).

## Infographic

Currently, the Market Analyzing Unit of the Federal Office for Agriculture (FOAG) already publishes a set of infographics, in the form of static PDFs, which cover selected agricultural markets in order to communicate the most relevant figures along their individual value chains.
As part of this project, this information was made available in the form of a dynamic, interactive and user-friendly website.

### Design Concept

The design concepts and variants for the potato market infographic are available in the following form:

- [Clickable InVision prototype (Mobile version)](/invision-prototypes/infographic-mobile/index.html)
- [Keyscreen Mockups (ZIP file)](/keyscreens/200326_market-data-platform-infographic-keyscreens.zip)

Eventually each agricultural market will have its own infographic, explaining the most important figures and information about each of them.

In order to achieve this vision, we aimed to create a simple design system that would allow us to create a consistent user experience across the different markets, while also allowing enough room for the individual expression of the different markets. This is to be achieved by defining a holistic, reusable content structure, as well as a simple and intuitive navigation pattern.

Each infographic will be based on a multi-step structure, detailing the market value chain, as well as the option to drill-down into individual aspects for each step in the value chain. Furthermore, we suggest that there should be a finite set of chart-types used across the different market infographics, in order to reduce implementation complexity and thus increasing the consistency and reproducibility of the individual infographics.

For the prototype we chose to follow a «mobile-first» approach, focusing on the best possible user experience, while considering their unique and intuitive interaction patterns, as well as their inherent limitations in regards to their screen-size and readability.

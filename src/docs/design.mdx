## Market Data Platform

The Agriculture Market Data Platform serves as the communication central hub of the Market Analyzing Unit of the Federal Office for Agriculture (FOAG). It provides access to the latest news, general information, reports and customized data queries for each of the different market areas.

**Backlog (Feedback)**

- **ID-1:** Both scenarios should be possible: Embedding a PowerBI report within a page of the Market Data Platform or adding just a link to an external PowerBI report.
- **ID-2:** The newest version of the prototype already includes the language selection also on mobile.
- **ID-4:** An adaptation of the Visualization-Tool was not part of the prototype phase and as such the introduction of a infobox or user-guide will be evaluated during the implementation phase.
- **ID-5:** The hierarchical structure of the header-navigation will be revisited during the implementation phase and depends on the final information architecture (sitemap) of the market data platform. In general, it would be possible to add an additional sub-level to the «Data» section, if necessary.
- **ID-6:** The size and design of individual icons can easily be adjusted during the implementation phase. The current design should be viewed as a preliminary design concept and does not necessarily represent the final design.
- **ID-7:** Technically, it would be possible to give direct access to sub-pages from the homepage. A potential design solution heavily depends on the exact requirements resp. use-cases for this a feature, which shall be defined during the implementation phase.
- **ID-8:** A basic version of the logo has already been implemented. Additional animations or behaviors of the header element, will be explored during the implementation phase.
- **ID-11:** The order can easily be changed — currently the position is hard coded.
- **ID-12:** The integration of a blog is possible. Its requirements need to be further defined during the implementation phase.
- **ID-15:** It is currently not possible to view scripts or HTML/CSS code within the CMS.
- **ID-16:** The current prototype is not optimized for printing. As printing of web-content is a complex topic, more precise requirements need to be defined, in order for us to improve upon the current state during the implementation phase.
- **ID-17:** Updating the data for the infographics is possible, as described in the current prototype.
- **ID-18:** As the current design is not to be considered final, all icons, the infographic, as well as all other illustrative assets should not be shared or re-used outside of the context of the prototype.

## Infographic Prototype

Currently, the Market Analyzing Unit of the Federal Office for Agriculture (FOAG) already publishes a set of infographics, in the form of static PDFs, which cover selected agricultural markets in order to communicate the most relevant figures along their individual value chains. 
As part of this project, this information was made available in the form of a dynamic, interactive and user-friendly website. 

### Design Concept

Eventually each agricultural market will have its own infographic, explaining the most important figures and information about each of them.

In order to achieve this vision, we aimed to create a simple design system that would allow us to create a consistent user experience across the different markets, while also allowing enough room for the individual expression of the different markets. This is to be achieved by defining a holistic, reusable content structure, as well as a simple and intuitive navigation pattern. 

Each infographic will be based on a multi-step structure, detailing the market value chain, as well as the option to drill-down into individual aspects for each step in the value chain. Furthermore, we suggest that there should be a finite set of chart-types used across the different market infographics, in order to reduce implementation complexity and thus increasing the consistency and reproducibility of the individual infographics.

For the prototype we chose to follow a «mobile-first» approach, focusing on the best possible user experience, while considering their unique and intuitive interaction patterns, as well as their inherent limitations in regards to their screen-size and readability.
